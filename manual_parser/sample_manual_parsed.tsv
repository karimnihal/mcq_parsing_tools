7940	hau	prompt_1	high_school_microeconomics	"b: wannan shine raguwar dawowar ma'auni a doguwar tafiya

explanation: the scenario describes a situation where each additional unit of labor results in a smaller increase in output. initially, adding one unit of labor increases output by 50 units (from 300 to 350), but adding another unit of labor increases output by only 25 units (from 350 to 375). this pattern is characteristic of diminishing returns to a factor, which typically occurs in the short run when one factor of production is fixed. however, since the question mentions ""doguwar tafiya"" (long run), the correct interpretation is that it is describing diminishing returns to scale, which is a similar concept but applies when all factors of production can be varied."

4071	lug	prompt_1	elementary_mathematics	"to solve this problem, we first need to understand the sequence given: 20, 40, 60, 80, ...

this is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by a common difference. the common difference here is 20, as each term is 20 more than the previous one.

the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d \]

where \( a_1 \) is the first term, \( d \) is the common difference, and \( n \) is the term number.

in this sequence:
- \( a_1 = 20 \)
- \( d = 20 \)

we need to find the 8th term (\( a_8 \)):

\[ a_8 = 20 + (8-1) \cdot 20 \]
\[ a_8 = 20 + 7 \cdot 20 \]
\[ a_8 = 20 + 140 \]
\[ a_8 = 160 \]

therefore, the 8th term in the sequence is 160.

the key information provided is:
- at store a, the price of phone repair services increases by 5%, and the quantity demanded increases.

the question is asking us to determine the nature of the relationship between the two stores based on this information.

let's examine the choices:

a: obwagazi bw'ebyamaguzi by'edduuka b bukyukakyuka n'ebbeeyi (the demand for goods at store b is elastic with respect to price)
